
FPGA Development Environment:

 PC, WinXP

   Currently, development has been done using Windows XP,
 but the only platform specific programs are the batch
 files used for simulation and verification.


================================================================

FPGA Software:

 The required FPGA tools are free (as in free beer)

   Currently using Webpack 9.2 SP4 for the Xilinx Spartan3 demo 
 project, and Lattice Diamond 1.4 for the Lattice XP2 demo project.
 
   Later S/W versions will likely work, but will probably require 
 changes to the project and constraint files due to differences in 
 the FPGA development tools.


 Xilinx Webpack: 

  - Xilinx WebPack 9.2 with SP4
  
    Xilinx site registration is required for download.

    The following files are needed for installation:
      WebPACK_SFD_92i.zip      9.2i Webpack single file download 
      9_2_04i_win.exe          Service Pack 4

    As of August 2011, the files can be found here:

    http://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.htm

      - click "archive" on the left version list

      - expand the "+9.2", look for "ISE Foundation WebPACK - 9.2i Full Product Installation"

      - expand the "+9.2 SP4", look for "ISE Foundation - 9.2i Service Pack 4"


 Lattice Diamond: 

    Lattice Diamond 1.4

    Site registration required.

    Free license supports many Lattice device families.

================================================================

VHDL simulator:

  Currently using GHDL for the testbench simulator

  Either of the following GHDL versions ( intermediate versions tend to crash on WinXP ):

    GHDL 0.25
    http://ghdl.free.fr/ghdl-installer-0.25.exe

    GHDL 0.29.1+ patched to resolve stack crashes and windows path issues
    ( add download link )


================================================================

Other Software needed:


Perl 5.6.1 or greater             

   The cross assembler and verification tools are written in Perl.
