
FPGA Development Environment:

 PC, WinXP

   Currently, development has been done using Windows XP,
 but the only platform specific programs are the batch
 files used for simulation and verification.


================================================================

FPGA Software:

 The required FPGA tools are free (as in free beer)


 Xilinx Webpack: 

  - Xilinx WebPack 9.2 with SP4
  
    Xilinx site registration is required for download.

    The following files are needed for installation:
      WebPACK_SFD_92i.zip      9.2i Webpack single file download 
      9_2_04i_win.exe          Service Pack 4

    Aas of August 2011, the files can be found here:

VHDL simulator:

  Currently using GHDL for the testbench simulator

  Either of the following GHDL versions ( intermediate versions tend to crash on WinXP ):

    GHDL 0.25
    http://ghdl.free.fr/ghdl-installer-0.25.exe

    GHDL 0.29.1+ patched to resolve stack crashes and windows path issues
    ( add download link )


================================================================

Other Software needed:


Perl 5.6.1 or greater             

   The cross assembler and verification tools are written in Perl.
