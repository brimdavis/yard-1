
 YARD-1 Licenses:


    - Most of the YARD-1 VHDL code and support files are released 
      under the BSD 2-clause license.

      See license/bsd_2-clause.txt

************

      Note that the Google Code project hosting site license selection
      originally linked to the BSD 2-clause license for projects that had 
      selected "New BSD License" from the Google Code license choices.

      On Aug 13, 2012, Google "fixed" this by silently changing the project
      license link to point to the 3-clause BSD license instead.

      It would perhaps have been more useful to change the _description_
      to read "Modified BSD" or "2-clause BSD", and leave the link alone.

      I have since changed the Google Code license to "other" and updated 
      this file accordingly.

    - The main cross assembler file, <yas.pl>, is based on other free
      Perl cross assemblers, and uses the original free license terms
