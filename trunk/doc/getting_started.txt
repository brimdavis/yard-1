
Installation:

 - unzip the project .zip file to a directory such as c:\projects\yard

     preferably a path without spaces, as some of the FPGA tools take issue with spacey paths

 - all tools are run from a command shell ( see next section )

 - example install:

    > md c:\projects
    > cd c:\projects
    > unzip PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_FILE\yard-1_v-0-0-2-alpha.zip
    > dir yard



Command Shell path setup:

  - open a command prompt

  - cd to your chosen install directory  

  - execute the <yen.bat> file found therein to set up paths and environment variables

      > cd c:\projects\yard
      > yen


Assembling and Linking a program :

  [ command shell path setup ]

  > cd programs\hello
  > yas hello.asm
  > ylink hello.obj


  At this point, the linker will have created several output files; vhdl source
 files <hello.vh1>, <hello.vh2> for simulation or synthesis, and a <hello.cmd> 
 file for download to YARDBUG.



Downloading a program to YARDBUG :

  - open hyperterminal or equivalent

  - 19200,n,8,1 RS232 connection to evaluation board

  - download or otherwise start up FPGA board

  - should see YARDBUG banner and '@' prompt 

  - send ASCII file <hello.cmd>

  - G 600


YARDBUG commands :

   D  ADDR COUNT        Dump memory

   G  ADDR              Go

   M  ADDR BYTE {BYTE}  Modify byte(s)

   ?                    help

  e.g.:
    D 0 100        ; dump 256 bytes starting at zero
    G 0            ; jump to address 0
    M 600 00       ; byte at $600 = 0
    M 601 ff ee    ; byte at $601 = $ff, $602 = $ee



Running verification simulations :

  [ requires GHDL ]
  [ command shell path setup ]

  - cd into to the verify subdirectory

      > cd verify           

  - run a single test :

      > v alu\addsub1

  - run all tests:

      > vall

  - summarize test results:

      > vsummary

  - search for failed tests:

      > vfailed
