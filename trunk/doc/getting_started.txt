
Installation:

  - Pick a location for the project; e.g. C:\projects\yard

     - preferably a path without spaces, as some of the FPGA tools take issue with spacey paths

  
  - From the repository:

     - check out the SVN trunk to the project directory, i.e. c:\projects\yard


  - From a zip file (none available at the moment, eventually will be in project downloads) :

     - unzip the project .zip file to the project directory, e.g. c:\projects\yard

     - example install:

       > md c:\projects
       > cd c:\projects
       > unzip PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_FILE\yard-1_v-0-0-2-alpha.zip
       > dir yard


  - All tools are run from a command shell ( see next section for path setup )


Command Shell path setup:

  - open a command prompt

  - cd to your chosen install directory  

  - execute the <yen.bat> file found therein to set up paths and environment variables

      > cd c:\projects\yard
      > yen


Assembling and Linking a program :

  [ command shell path setup ]

  > cd programs\hello
  > yas hello.s
  > ylink hello.obj


  At this point, the linker will have created several output files:

    <hello.vh1> VHDL memory data arrays for simulation or synthesis
    <hello.vh2> VHDL memory INIT vectors for Xilinx BRAM primitives

    <hello.ymm> YARDBUG command file to download program with memory modify commands


Downloading a program to YARDBUG :

  - open hyperterminal or equivalent

  - 19200,n,8,1 RS232 connection to evaluation board

  - download or otherwise start up FPGA board

  - should see YARDBUG banner and '@' prompt 

  - send ASCII file <hello.ymm>

  - G 600


YARDBUG commands :

   D  ADDR COUNT        Dump memory

   G  ADDR              Go

   M  ADDR BYTE {BYTE}  Modify byte(s)

   ?                    help

  e.g.:
    D 0 100        ; dump 256 bytes starting at zero
    G 0            ; jump to address 0
    M 600 00       ; byte at $600 = 0
    M 601 ff ee    ; byte at $601 = $ff, $602 = $ee



Running verification simulations :

  [ requires GHDL ]
  [ command shell path setup ]

  - cd into to the verify subdirectory

      > cd verify           

  - run a single test :

      > v alu\addsub1

  - run all tests:

      > vall

  - summarize test results:

      > vsummary

  - search for failed tests:

      > vfailed
